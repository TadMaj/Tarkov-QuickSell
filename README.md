# QuickSell

A mod for excape from tarkov that introduces more ways to sell your items quickly.

Two context menu options are added for items in the stash. They allow you to quick sell items to the flea or traders. When selling on the fleamarket items get listed for the average price shown on the add listing window. When selling items to traders the highest price offering is picked automatically.
